# Lab - Importing a Dataset

Now that you have some background about MongoDB's server tools, use mongoimport to import a JSON dataset into MongoDB. You can find the dataset inside the Vagrant box in /dataset/products.json, or in the lesson handout.

Import the whole dataset with your application's user m103-application-user into a collection called products, in the database applicationData.

When you're finished, run the following validation script in your vagrant and outside the mongo shell and enter the validation key you receive below. If you receive an error, it should give you some idea of what went wrong.

```
vagrant@m103:~$ validate_lab_import_dataset
```
