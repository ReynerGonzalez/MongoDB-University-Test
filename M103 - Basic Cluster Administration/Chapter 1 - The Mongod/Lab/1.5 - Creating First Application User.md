# Lab - Creating First Application User

In the first lab, you created a user with the root role on the admin database. The requirements are listed here:

- run on port 27000
- data files are stored in /var/mongodb/db/
- listens to connections from the IP address 192.168.103.100 and localhost
- authentication is enabled
- root user on admin database with username: m103-admin and password: m103-pass

The root role is one of the most powerful roles in a Mongo cluster, and has many privileges which are never used by a typical application. In this lab, you will create a new user for an application that has the readWrite role, because the application does not need to monitor the cluster or create users - it only needs to read and write data.

The requirements for this new user are:

- Role: readWrite on applicationData database
- Authentication source: admin
- Username: m103-application-user
- Password: m103-application-pass

You don't need to make any changes to your mongod configuration, but it must be running with authentication enabled. If your configuration does not use authentication, this lab may fail to validate.

When you're finished, run the following validation script in your vagrant and outside the mongo shell and enter the validation key you receive below. If you receive an error, it should give you some idea of what went wrong.

```
vagrant@m103:~$ validate_lab_first_application_user
```
