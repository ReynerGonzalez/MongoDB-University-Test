# Lab - Logging to a Different Facility

By default, mongod sends diagnostic logging information to the standard output, occupying the terminal window where mongod was started. In this lab, you will tell mongod to send those logs to a file so you can fork the mongod process and continue to use the terminal window where mongod was started. You'll also change some of the default log settings.

Your task for this lab is to change the config file such that:

- mongod sends logs to /var/mongodb/db/mongod.log
- mongod is forked and run as a daemon (this will not work without a logpath)
- any query that takes 50ms or longer is logged (remember to specify this in the configuration file!)

Note: Using db.setProfilingLevel() will not work for this lab, because this command will not persist data in the config file - if the mongod process shuts down, such as during a maintenance procedure, the profiling level set with db.setProfilingLevel() will be lost.

All of the other information in your config file should stay the same as in the previous lab.

When you're finished, run the following validation script in your vagrant and outside the mongo shell and enter the validation key you receive below. If you receive an error, it should give you some idea of what went wrong.

```
vagrant@m103:~$ validate_lab_different_logpath
```
