# Lab - Configuration File

In this lab, you're going to launch a mongod instance in the vagrant environment with the same exact settings as the previous lab. However this time, those settings will be defined in a configuration file instead of the command line. It is required for this lab that you use the YAML format to construct this config file.

As a reminder, here are the requirements of your mongod instance:

- run on port 27000
- data files are stored in /data/db/
- listens to connections from the IP address 192.168.103.100 and localhost
- authentication is enabled

If you created the user from the previous lab, you don't need to create any new users. If you did not create the user, do so now. Here are the requirements for that user:

- Role: root on admin database
- Username: m103-admin
- Password: m103-pass.

When your config file is complete, launch mongod with the --config <config_filepath> command line option with the filepath to your config file in place of config_filepath (you can also use the -f option instead of --config).

When you're finished, run the following validation script in your vagrant and outside the mongo shell and enter the validation key you receive below. If you receive an error, it should give you some idea of what went wrong.

```
vagrant@m103:~$ validate_lab_configuration_file
```
