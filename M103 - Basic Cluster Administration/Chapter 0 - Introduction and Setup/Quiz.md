## Setting Up the Vagrant Environment

Why are we using a Vagrant environment?

- **Vagrant makes it easy to copy files from your host machine to the VM.**
- **Labs can be completed without interfering with existing settings on your host machine.**
- **The VM comes with all dependencies necessary for this course.**
- **Troubleshooting is easier when all students are using the same VM.**
