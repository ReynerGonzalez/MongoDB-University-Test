# Lab - Read Concern and Read Preferences

In this lab, you will take advantage of different read preferences to increase the availability of your replica set.

To begin, load the dataset in your Vagrant box into your replica set:

```
mongoimport --drop \
--host m103-repl/192.168.103.100:27002,192.168.103.100:27001,192.168.103.100:27003 \
-u "m103-admin" -p "m103-pass" --authenticationDatabase "admin" \
--db applicationData --collection products /dataset/products.json
```

You can check that you've loaded the entire dataset by verifying that there are exactly 516784 documents in the applicationData.products collection:

```
use applicationData
db.products.count()
```

Once the dataset is fully imported into your replica set, you will simulate a node failure. This is similar to the previous lab, but this time you will shut down two nodes.

When two of your nodes are unresponsive, you will not be able to connect to the replica set. You will have to connect to the third node, which should be the only healthy node in the cluster.

Which of these readPreferences will allow you to read data from this node?
