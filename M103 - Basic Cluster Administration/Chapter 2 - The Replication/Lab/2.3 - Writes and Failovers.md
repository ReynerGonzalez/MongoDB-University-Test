# Lab - Writes with Failovers

In this lab, you will attempt to write data with a writeConcern to a replica set where one node has failed.

In order to simulate a node failure within your replica set, you will connect to the node individually and shut it down. Connecting back to the replica set and running rs.status() should show the failing node with a description like this:

```
{
  "name" : "m103:27001",
  "health" : 0,
  "stateStr" : "(not reachable/healthy)",
  "lastHeartbeatMessage" : "Connection refused",
  "configVersion" : -1
}
```

With one of your nodes down, attempt to insert a document in your replica set by running the following commands:

```
use testDatabase
db.new_data.insert({"m103": "very fun"}, { writeConcern: { w: 3, wtimeout: 1000 }})
```

This will attempt to insert one record into a collection called testDatabase.new_data, while verifying that 3 nodes registered the write. It should return an error, because only 2 nodes are healthy.

Given the output of the insert command, and your knowledge of writeConcern, check all that apply:



- w: "majority" would also cause this write operation to return with an error.
- **When a writeConcernError occurs, the document is still written to the healthy nodes.**
- **The unhealthy node will be receiving the inserted document when it is brought back online.**
- The write operation will always return with an error, even if wtimeout is not specified.
