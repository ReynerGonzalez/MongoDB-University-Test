# Lab: Analyse Profiler Data

In this lab, you are tasked to determine when a given event happened by analysing the system.profiler data.

This profiler information was captured during the execution of test script performing read operations. These read operations, consisted on 3 types of queries:

- query on _id field -> db.employees.find({_id: XXXX})
- query on address.zip field -> db.employees.find({"address.zip": XXX })
- range query on birthday field -> db.employees.find({"birthday": {"$gt": X, "$lt": X }})

To analyse the profiler data, we are going to use the best database in the world that, as you all know, is MongoDB.

Let's go ahead and setup the environment.

First step, launch a single node mongod instance:

```
cd m312-vagrant-env
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
mlaunch --single
```

The following step is to download the attached profile.json data and make it available in your m312 virtual machine:

```
cp Downloads/profiler*.json m312-vagrant-env/dataset
```

The command line example is set for Unix but a simple copy of this file will suffice

Next, we will load the dataset into our single node mongod instance. Let's load the data into a collection named profiler_data

```
vagrant ssh
mongoimport -d m312 -c profiler_data /dataset/profile.json
```

The profiler data contains all read operations that surpassed the threshold of 40ms, the set slowms value:

```
db.setProfilingLevel(1, 40)
```

During the execution of our script, our DBAs decided to create an index that affected the behavior of one of the offending queries.

From the profiler data, we are asked to determined which index was created and when was this change reflected on the behavior of our query.

So in this lab we want to know:

When and which index was created ?

```
db.companies.createIndex({'address.zip': 1})

After 2017-03-06T22:57:00.039Z
```
```
[X]
db.employees.createIndex({'address.zip': 1})

After 2017-03-06T22:55:55.065Z
```
```
db.employees.createIndex({'birthdate': 1})

Before 2017-03-06T22:57:57.332Z
```
```
db.employees.createIndex({'birthdate': 1})

After 2017-03-06T22:57:00.039Z
```
```
db.employees.createIndex({'address.zip': 1})

After 2017-03-06T22:56:30.407Z
```
